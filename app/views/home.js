            <h2>THE KILLER B: BRAIN CANCER</h2>
            <h4>We&rsquo;re here to assist Australian people effected by brain cancer in a unique way!</h4>
            <p>The Killer B Foundation is a non-for-profit organisation that takes a very unique approach to fundraising. The Killer B Foundation holds an annual event known as the &ldquo;Annual Postie Bike Challenge&rdquo; or also known as the &ldquo;APBC&rdquo; where all participants ride Postie Bikes embarking on crazy adventures, crossing state lines and camping whilst raising vital needed funds and having a blast along the way!</p>
            <p>All funds raised by The Killer B Foundation go directly to people affected by brain cancer. We do not put funds into brain cancer research; we invest the money into local communities to assist in upgrading of facilities, providing transport for patients or providing funds to patients that simply cant afford the treatment they deserve.</p>
            <p>For any questions or enquires please <a href="mailto:admin@killerbfoundation.org">contact us</a>.</p>
